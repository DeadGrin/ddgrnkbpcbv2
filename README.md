Orholinear keyboard 5x14 with OLED screen

Case - 10$ (for my geo): Layer design: 3mm plexiglass (bottom), 3d printed frame, 6mm plexiglass (plate), screwed with M2 screws (tried top plate with inserting nuts but i messed up with them and put regular nuts instead)

MCU - 4$: Pico Boot (Type-C, RP2040)

Switches - 16$: JWK T1 67g

Keycaps - 13$: Noname from ali, some kind of XDA but taller than XDA.

PCB - 16$: Custom designed PCB to reduce production cost (i don't need 5x full size pcbs) so it's cheaper to make such modules, but easier to use than 1x1 pcbs.
